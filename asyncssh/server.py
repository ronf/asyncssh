class SSHServer:
    """SSH server protocol handler

       Applications may subclass this when implementing an SSH server to
       provide custom authentication and request handlers.

       Whenever a new SSH server connection is accepted, a corresponding
       SSHServer object is created and the method :meth:`connection_made`
       is called, passing in the :class:`SSHServerConnection` object.

       When the connection is closed, the method :meth:`connection_lost`
       is called with an exception representing the reason for the
       disconnect, or `None` if the connection was closed cleanly.

       The method :meth:`begin_auth` can be overridden decide whether
       or not authentication is required, and additional callbacks are
       provided for each form of authentication in cases where authentication
       information is not provided in the call to :func:`create_server`.

       In addition, the methods :meth:`session_requested`,
       :meth:`connection_requested`, :meth:`server_requested`,
       :meth:`unix_connection_requested`, or :meth:`unix_server_requested`
       can be overridden to handle requests to open sessions or direct
       connections or set up listeners for forwarded connections.

       .. note:: The authentication callbacks described here can be
                 defined as coroutines. However, they may be cancelled if
                 they are running when the SSH connection is closed by
                 the client. If they attempt to catch the CancelledError
                 exception to perform cleanup, they should make sure to
                 re-raise it to allow AsyncSSH to finish its own cleanup.
